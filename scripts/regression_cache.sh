# Fingerprint inputs:
#   - Compiler snapshot mtime (env KORU_COMPILER_MTIME, set once per suite run).

# Backend-cache keys: the LINKED CLOSURE, not the directory
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A build-cache key must be COMPLETE (every file the binary embeds) and MINIMAL
# (nothing else), and the two errors cost opposite things. An omission serves a
# stale backend — see frag-a-backend-cache-keyed-on-mtime-can-serve-poison. An
# inclusion re-mints every cached backend for an edit that cannot change one.
#
# This cache spent its life over-approximating instead: the salt hashed
# src/ + koru_std/ + build.zig, 269 files, while a test's backend links 51 of
# them. So any edit to anything covered re-minted all ~121 backends — including
# src/main.zig (8k lines of CLI the backend never links) and koru_std/*.kz
# (comptime module sources whose effect on a given test is already carried by
# that test's emitted file, which the key hashes by itself). Measured
# 2026-09-17: 5 of the day's 13 compiler commits touched nothing the backend
# links, and each threw the whole cache away — all-or-nothing, per commit.
#
# The closure is derivable, so the approximation is not needed.
#
# Cost discipline: this runs once per test, so the walk spawns nothing per file.
# It was written with a per-file `shasum` first and measured 3.2s per key —
# `shasum` is a Perl script here, ~87ms of startup per call, against 3ms for one
# `sha256sum` over ten files. What remains is one awk for the build graph, zero
# subprocesses per walked file, and one bulk hash for the whole closure.

# $BACKEND_CACHE_DIR is ONE flat directory shared by every checkout on this
# machine ($TMPDIR is per-user, not per-worktree) and written by TWO producers
# with different naming schemes:
#
#   - this harness — backend_cache_key (regression_lib.sh): sha256 of the
#     backend's build inputs, 64 hex chars.
#   - koruc itself — backendCacheKey (src/main.zig): FNV1a-64 over src/ and
#     koru_std/, printed `{x}` — unpadded, so 14..16 hex chars.
#
# Neither evicted. Measured 2026-09-17: 3382 entries / 33.8 GB, of which 223 of
# koruc's entries were byte-identical to a harness entry (two schemes, one
# binary, stored twice). The only in-tree way it ever shrank was
# run_regression.sh --clean, which rm -rf's the whole cache by hand.
#
# So the prune below is SCHEME-AGNOSTIC on purpose: it must bound koruc's
# entries too, or the leak survives in the half no harness code touches.

# Byte cap on the shared backend cache (env KORU_BACKEND_CACHE_MAX_BYTES).
# Sized for the working set, not for tidiness: a generation is ~1.2 GB (121
# distinct backends x 9.6 MB) and this machine runs ~14 compiler checkouts, each
# legitimately at a different commit and wanting its own. Below ~14 generations
# the checkouts evict each other and the cache stops paying for itself — an
# entry costs 1.2 GB of disk to save ~120 backend builds, so the cap exists to
# stop unbounded growth, not to make the cache small.
