provenance: Goose-race json, 2026-10-22 — the suite read "parser 1.23x
  behind Goose, 3.4x the RSS" and the investigation opened on the emitted
  recursive-descent scanner. The whole deficit was io.kz's read-file:
  readToEndAlloc's chunked growth copied a 115MB file ~3x, inflating peak
  RSS to 443MB and the row to 1.23x. stat+alloc+readAll: 0.97x, RSS parity.

# A deficit attributed to the kernel can live in the input path (belief)

The json row read as a parser loss: 1.23x behind Goose's hand-tuned reader
(DIGIT_PAIRS, POW10_128 tables) with 3.4x its RSS, and the obvious fix was
scanner plumbing — fused token loops, cheaper skip, one-pass numbers. The
measured decomposition said otherwise: stubbing parseFloat moved nothing
(~15ms), and the remaining scanner profile was inside noise of Goose's
instruction count. The actual deficit was upstream of the benchmarked code:
**`io:read-file` used `readToEndAlloc`, whose chunked growth copied the
115MB input ~3x** — 443MB peak RSS for a 115MB file, page-fault and memcpy
traffic timed inside the row. A stat-sized single `readAll` reads the same
file at 116MB and closed the row to 0.97x with no parser change at all.

The working hypothesis had a silent scope: "the benchmark measures the
parse." It measures the process — input acquisition is inside the clock.
The cheapest wrong story here would have been a week of scanner work
buying the ~10ms that remained. This is
[[frag-the-vectorizer-checks-the-emitted-shape-not-the-structure]]'s
discipline applied one level up: the emitted shape held the answer, but
the right emitted *function* was `read_file`, not `__jobj`. A deficit
decomposes before it yields — measure the whole path, in pieces small
enough to falsify (stub the candidate, watch the clock), before touching
the code the story blames.

The same defect lived twice: `fs:read-lines` slurped through the same
`readToEndAlloc` growth under an `aspirational` note that correctly
described the streaming gap while leaving the cheaper defect unmeasured.
An honest annotation about the big gap is not evidence the small one is
closed.

## Open questions

- `io:read-stdin` keeps chunked growth (correct — no stat on a stream) but
  could still over-copy on known-size redirects; unmeasured.
- The arena parser still materializes the `coordinates` array where Goose
  streams; on larger docs that shape may become the real deficit.
